    Select a filtered subset of images based on contribution to the 3D reconstruction.

    Parameters:
        rec (pycolmap.Reconstruction): The original reconstruction.
        max_num_images (int): Optional cap on number of images to retain.
        keep_unique_point_ratio (float): Min ratio of unique 3D points to retain an image.
        min_2d3d_ratio_percentile (float): Filter out images below this percentile of 2D–3D match ratio.
        min_triangulated_percentile (float): Filter out images below this percentile of triangulated 3D points.
        min_geometric_distance (float): Min Euclidean distance to retain geometric diversity.

    Returns:
        List[int]: Sorted list of selected frame indices (int).
