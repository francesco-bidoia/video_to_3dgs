def is_reconstruction_good(rec, local_overlap_threshold=20, global_overlap_threshold=50, max_bad_pairs_ratio=0.0):
    """
    Evaluate the quality of a reconstruction based on overlap metrics between consecutive images.
    
    Local quality is defined by requiring that the overlap for each image pair is above
    a minimum threshold. Global quality is measured as the average overlap across all pairs.
    
    Parameters:
        rec: Reconstruction object with an 'images' attribute.
        local_overlap_threshold (int): Minimum acceptable overlap count for each consecutive image pair.
                                       This value should be determined empirically.
        global_overlap_threshold (int): Minimum acceptable average overlap across all consecutive pairs.
        max_bad_pairs_ratio (float): Maximum allowed ratio of image pairs below the local threshold.
                                     Set to 0.0 for a strict requirement.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the reconstruction meets both local and global quality criteria, False otherwise.
